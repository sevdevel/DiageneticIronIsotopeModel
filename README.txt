The directory contains several folders:

=========================
SourceCode/
=========================

Contains the basic model code; 
'FeisoBASE' is the 'generic' model as described in the MS
'FeisoCALIB' is the 'site-specific' model as described in the MS

=========================
SiteFit/
=========================

Contains the simulation files for the best-fit runs;
'Sims MC' is the simulation file for Monterey Canyon 
'Sims SBB' is the simulation file for Santa Barbara Basin

01 for bulk concentrations, 02 for isotopes

=========================
Sensitivity_bioturbation
=========================

Contains the simulation files for the sensitivity runs of
iron isotope signatures to changes in bioturbation (see MS for details)

=========================
Predictive_bioturbation
=========================

Contains the simulations for the predictive functions (see MS for details)

=========================
Predictive_nobioturbation
=========================

Contains the simulations for the predictive functions (see MS for details)

=========================
SimulationFiles
=========================

Contain the simulation files with higher/lower FeOOH fluxes or SO4 bottom-water 
concentrations (see MS for details)
